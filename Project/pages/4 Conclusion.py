        "As I looked through the data it was quite easy to notice patterns, the most obvious being Nintendo, another pattern that was present that I only briefly mentioned is games were sperated by console they were sold on. So theres a solid chance that Wii sports wasn't the number one game and could be knocked off by soemthing like Grand Theft Auto Five which was quite highly ranked on the list twice"
        "Another data point I didn't delve much into was how sales stacked up against each other based on region, Something like Wii sports sold well in NA, EU and Japense markets but that wasn't entirely true for everything. It was also noticeable that Nintendo sold a lot better in Japanese markets as well which I think is worth metnioning"
        "Overall there is a lot of data too be taken away from this especially if your thinking about selling a game or publish through a larger machine Hope I helped you parse through it even if it was just a little bit!")
