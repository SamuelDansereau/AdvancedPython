This could will not compile in an editor as it is built through streamlit:
To run it you need to have streamlit installed but if its there, 
1. Open up the command line
2. cd into wherever the project file inside my repo is for you for example for me it is cd Desktop\Python\AdvancedPython\Project
3. Once your in there you just do the command streamlit run main.py
That should work to make it run but I will be including A video within this repo of my project as well just in case
